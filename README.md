# vertex-ai-search-widget-styling
Reaches into the nested shadow roots of the Google Vertex AI search widget, and allows you to style it.

The default widget includes a shadow root nested within another shadow root. This will traverse the DOM adding styles to each shadow root.

While this is a PHP page, the JavaScript inside it can be used in anything, including a regular HTML page -- you simply have to edit out the PHP stanza at the befinning, and edit out the php call in the line where the HREF attribute is set.

Open to PRs and feedback.
